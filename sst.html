         <h5 class="card-title">INDIA-CHINA BORDER DISPUTE</h5> 
          <p class="card-text"> A military standoff between India and China on their disputed border in the Himalayas are escalated into deadly clash.
The military superpower have been arguing for decades over territory in the high altitude largely uninhabitated region.
The armies from both side comes face to face along the 3488 km shared border. 
The confrontation came after tension bubbled up in recent months over a new road that India built in Ladakh along the 
LAC (line of actual control) which divides the sides that angered China which deployed troops and built infrastructure of
its own in disputed territory bringing the two sides forces closer and increasening the risk of clashes.
the first official acknowledgement of tension on border came on May 10, when the army issued a statement about clashes
between Indian and Chinese patrols at two place. In Naku la of  Sikkim on May 9, a Chinese patrol on Indian side of LAC was
confronted by an Indian patrol which led to clash. The army also said  that a more serious incident that took placeon the night
of  May5-6 in the Pangong Tso lake area during which soldiers from both sides were injured.
At least 20 Indian soldiers were killed in 15th june's night incident. It happened in Galwan valley in the disputed area of ladakh region.
China accused Indian troops of crossing the border twice,"provoking and attacking chinese personnel". Both side insisted that no 
shots were fired . Indian officials gave accounts of fighting with bare hand, iron rod and stones. There were reports of Chinese casualities
but no official confirmation. Both side see the area as strategically, economically and militarily important. If efforts to reduce tension fails, 
there is a risk of escalation between two rivals who happens to be most populous countries -and have nuclear weapons. This is extremely, 
extremely serious. Also our Indian army is fully trained to engage and distroy the enemies and our Air force also have some advantages.
As we all know that Air force play a great role during a war for supply of arms and ammunition and food and to support the land troops .
IAF currently enjoys both a qualitative and quantitative advantage over the People liberation army air force (PLAAF) across the LAC.
IAF currently has more operational bases then the PLAAF ,close to the LAC. Also China is attacking India because the President of china
Xi jinping has no one to blame for his failure and they were trying to do this to change global attention away from the pandemic.

        <div class="card-body bfont">
         <h5 class="card-title">INDIA A LAND OF UNITY IN DIVERSITY</h5> 
          <p class="card-text"> INDIA is a land of unity in divrsity. <b>"Unity in diversity"</b> refers to state of togetherness.<br>
   The History of Ancient India is intresting because India proved to be a melting pot of numerous races.<br>
   The Pre-Aryans, the Indo-Aryans, the Greeks, the Scythians, the Hunas, the Turk, etc. made India their home each group contributed its culture to the making of the indian culture.<br>
   All these people mixed in such a inseperately manner with one another that it is very difficult that at present none of them can be indentified in their present form.<br>
   Different culture mingled with one another through the ages.<br>
   Since Ancient India has been the land of several religion. Ancient India witnessed the birth of Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism.<br>
   All these cultures and religions intermingled with one another.
   Although Indian people speak different langauges practiced different religion and observe different social custom.
   They follow certain common style of life throughout the Country.<br>
   Therefore our country shows a deep underlying root of unity inspite of great diverity.<br>
   From the Indus valley civilisation to the India today, Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Christianity and many other religion peacefully coexist.<br>
            <b>Unity in diversity</b> is one of the most powerful characteristics.
    India has proved throughout the years and years of history that diversity does not pull people apart. It brings them closer together<br>
    The spirit of <b>"Unity in Diversity"</b> also put into our National Anthem by the phrase<b> "Punjab-Sindh-Gujarat-Maratha-Dravida-Utkala-Banga"</b>  
    The Unity was also recognised by foreigners. They first came into contact with the people living on the side of Sindu or Indus, and so they named the whole country after this river. <br>
    The word "Hind" is derived from the term "Sindhu" and in course of time the country came to known as "India" in greek and "Hind" in Persian and Arabic langauges .<br>
    Efforts for the linguistic and cultural unity of the Country were made through the ages.<br>
    The Indian culture and values and ideas were expressed in different forms, the substance remained the same throughout the Country.<br>
    Hence India has emerged a multi-Religion and multi-Cultural society.<br>
    However the underlying Unity and Integrity and plural character of India society remains the real strength for the development of the Country.<br>
